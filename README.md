# learning_management_system

As this is an academic project for a CS course at the University of Utah, I do not feel comfortable sharing the code in its entirety.

This project is a web-based (Django, Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, jQuery stack) learning management system allowing students to submit assignments and TAs to grade assignments. Used asynchronous web requests (AJAX) to handle these homework file uploads. The project was deployed to the cloud using an AWS EC2 instance via Linux terminal, with data stored and queried from a SQLite database to display dynamic web pages. This deployment has since been taken down, as I don't feel like spending money to keep it running.
